    <h2>Addendum: Process and Insights</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout the development of my Choose Your Own Adventure game, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user experience. The game follows the story of Cinderella, where the user is presented with different choices at key points in the narrative. Each choice leads to different outcomes, offering at least eight possible endings. 
    </p>
    <p>
        **Creative Choices**: I wanted to keep the design simple yet engaging. I used large buttons for the choices to make the interaction intuitive. I also added images to each stage of the story to visually enhance the player's experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Challenges**: One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the correct story content and corresponding images displayed based on the user's choices. I also needed to ensure that the page was dynamic, meaning the text and images updated properly every time a new decision was made.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Solutions**: To solve this, I structured my story in a JavaScript object, where each stage had associated text, choices, consequences, and image paths. The event listeners were used to change the content dynamically. I used CSS for styling the buttons and images to make the interface visually appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Insights**: This project reinforced my understanding of manipulating the DOM with JavaScript. It also helped me gain a deeper appreciation for user interaction and how choices in games can be linked to consequences that shape the narrative.
