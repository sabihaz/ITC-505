        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Published in 1813, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a novel set in
          the early 19th century that examines marriage, social status, and
          morality through the eyes of its colorful characters. Elizabeth
          Bennet, the story's bright and vivacious lead character, and her
          developing bond with the dapper and reticent Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy are
          the central themes of the narrative. Elizabeth initially views Mr.
          Darcy negatively and thinks he is conceited, but she is beginning to
          see his actual nature. Pride and Prejudice is an enduring and
          significant piece of English literature because of Jane Austen's
          astute observations on human nature and her humorous storytelling
          style.

      <section class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The story, which takes place in Regency-era England, explores the
          lives of the Bennet family, paying special attention to the astute and
          self-reliant Elizabeth Bennet. Elizabeth must negotiate the
          intricacies of social class and interpersonal connections in a culture
          where marriage is both a social requirement and a personal goal as the
          narrative progresses. Elizabeth and the mysterious and affluent Mr.
          Fitzwilliam Darcy have a dynamic connection that is at the center of
          the book. The story explores the effects of pride and social
          expectations on interpersonal relationships, with its initial
          misconceptions and prejudices serving as the backdrop. Austen
          underlines the need of self-awareness and mutual respect while
          criticizing the inflexible class structures of her era through a
          series of vibrant meetings and changing opinions.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Jane Austen blends social criticism and narrative devices in Pride and
          Prejudice:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Narrative Perspective:</b> The narrative is presented from a
          third-person omniscient point of view, giving readers insight into the
          characters' thoughts and feelings.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Character Development:</b> Austen gives significant attention to
          the relationships, dialogue, and actions of her characters,
          particularly those of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Their
          development mirrors the topics of the book.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Social Satire:</b> Using comedy and irony, the book exposes
          societal weaknesses and individual prejudices while criticizing early
          19th-century marital customs and social class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Dialogue:</b> Sharp and perceptive dialogue offers comments on
          interpersonal interactions and society ideals while revealing
          character attributes and moving the plot forward.

      <section class="discussion">
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          Jane Austen deftly examines socioeconomic status, pride, and prejudice
          in Pride and Prejudice via the prism of early 19th-century English
          society. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy's developing
          relationship is at the heart of the book. Elizabeth is initially
          swayed by her own preconceptions and the prevailing social hierarchy
          in her assessment of Darcy as conceited and pompous. On the other
          hand, Darcy's seeming haughtiness stems from his early pride and
          unwillingness to interact with people from lower socioeconomic
          classes. Both individuals have tremendous personal development as the
          narrative goes on. Elizabeth discovers how to confront her own
          prejudices and acknowledges the goodness and honesty that truly define
          Darcy. In a similar vein, Darcy learns the virtue of humility and the
          significance of overcoming social prejudice. Their final union
          highlights Austen's criticism of discrimination based on class as well
          as her support of individual virtue and respect for others,
          symbolizing a victory over social limits and personal shortcomings.
          Austen makes observations about the societal mores of her day, mainly
          the institution of marriage and class divisions, by using satire and
          irony. She advocates for a more compassionate and equitable
          understanding of human connections while exposing the flaws and
          limitations of social expectations through humorous conversation and
          character interactions. In the end, Pride and Prejudice presents a
          complex analysis of the ways in which personal shortcomings and
          society expectations can obstruct genuine comprehension and empathy.
          Through her story, Austen invites readers to consider their own
          opinions as well as how society standards affect their relationships
          and personal beliefs.

      <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, prejudice and pride are
          reconciled at the end. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet go above their
          early miscommunications and social barriers to discover love and
          respect for one another. The book emphasizes the value of developing
          oneself, becoming self-aware, and rejecting social conventions that
          prevent real interactions. Austen continues to explore character,
          society, and the transforming potential of empathy and understanding
          in her immortal works.

        <h2>Addendum: Explanation of Stylistic Choices</h2>
        <p>
          The following choices were made to improve the overall readability,
          aesthetics, and organization of the essay:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Font Choices:</b> I decided to use <i>Georgia</i> for the body
            text because it has a more formal and classic look, which I felt was
            a good fit for analyzing a literary work like
            <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. For the headings, I used
            <i>Arial</i> because it's modern and easy to read, helping the
            headings stand out clearly. The contrast between the two fonts makes
            the page look professional but still accessible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Text and Heading Sizes:</b> I made the main title
            (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) really large (2.5em) so that it’s clear
            it’s the most important part of the page. The section headings
            (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) are a bit smaller (2em) but still big
            enough to help organize the sections. For the body text, I used a
            slightly larger size (1.1em) than the default to make it easier to
            read on a screen without overwhelming the reader with too much text
            at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Color Choices:</b> I went with dark blue (#004080) for the
            headers because it looks professional and not too flashy. I used
            dark gray (#333333) for the main text because it’s softer than
            black, which can be a bit harsh on the eyes, especially when reading
            a lot of text. The light background (#f9f9f9) helps keep things
            simple and clean, making the text easier to read.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Margins and Padding Choices:</b> I gave the entire page plenty of
            margin space to prevent the text from looking cramped. There’s also
            extra padding around the headings and sections to separate them from
            each other. This makes the page look less cluttered and helps guide
            the reader's eyes through the content smoothly.
